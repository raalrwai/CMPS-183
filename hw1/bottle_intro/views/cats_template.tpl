<div class="third"><p> A new study finds polar bears in the wild have higher metabolic rates than previously thought, and as climate change alters their enviroment a growing number of bears are unable to catch enough prey to meet their energy needs.<br><br>The study, published February 2 in Science, reveals the physiological mechanisms behind observed declines in polar bear populations, said first author Anthony Pagano, a Ph.D. candidate at UC Santa Cruz.<br><br>"We've been documenting declines in polar bear survival rates, body condition, and population numbers over the past decade," he said. "This study identifies the mechanisms that are driving those declines by looking at the actual energy needs of polar bears and how often they're able to catch seals." </p></div>

<div class="third right"><h6>Unusual population of brown bears on Alaskan Islands turns out to have remarkable and revealing story</h6><br><h4>By Tim Stephens</h4><br><p> At the end of the last ice age, a population of polar bears was stranded by the receding ice on a few islands in southeastern Alaska. Male brown bears swam across to the islands from the Alaskan mainland and mated with female polar bears, eventually transforming the polar bear population into brown bears.</p></div>
